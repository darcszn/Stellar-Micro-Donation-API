I've created a comprehensive API flow diagram that shows how 
requests move through your system from the client to the Stellar 
network and back. 

The diagram features:

Main Components:

Clean SVG diagram showing 5 key stages: Client → API → Database → Stellar Network → Response
Color-coded boxes with icons for each layer
Directional arrows showing the request flow forward and response flow back
Detailed step descriptions explaining what happens at each stage


Clear labels and descriptions perfect for new contributors
A helpful note section explaining the flow
High-quality vector format (SVG) that will be added to document folder.

I also included the figma link to the design
